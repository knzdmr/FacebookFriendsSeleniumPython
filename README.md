this repo is created to show basic usage of selenium and unit-test in python

to use this python code you need to download a webdriver and set the driver path

selenium does not support Phanthomjs headless browser anymore (it might supported older version of selenium) if you want to use a headless browser you can use Firefox or Chrome headless without scrolling feature
